# Policy Evaluation, Reinforcement Learning

# About The Project

The policy evaluation algorithm is implemented in two ways:

- Direct form;
- iteration form.


# Getting Started

File to run: 

    /executor/executor.py

Policy evaluation implementation: 

    /MDP/policy_evaluation.py

Comparison of speed and accuracy is in the file (by the 'time' and 'acc' keys):

    /data/runs_stats.json

Parameters of the algorithm can be change in:

    configs/config.py
